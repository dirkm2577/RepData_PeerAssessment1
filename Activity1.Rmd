```{r}

activity$date <- strptime(activity$date, "%Y-%m-%d")
```

# What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

1. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

```{r}
activity2 <- data.frame("Date" = activity$date, "Steps" = activity$steps)
activity3 <- aggregate(Steps ~ Date, data = activity2, FUN = "sum")
```

2. Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day

```{r}
mean(activity3$Steps) # result is 10766.19
median(activity3$Steps) # result is 10765
```

The mean total number of steps taken per day is 10766.19.

The median for the total number of steps taken per day is 10765.
